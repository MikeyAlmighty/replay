# 9 - Keyboard

It would be nice to support pressing the space bar to jump for web users. But we have to keep in mind it won't work on iOS.

To do this we can look at the `inputs` object to see if it has a `keysDown` field - and if so, support pressing the space key. We'll do this check in `isWebInput` and put it in a separate `utils` file.

The fields `keysDown` and `keysJustPressed` contain an object which will have a `true` value for any key codes pressed. Check out [keycode.info](https://keycode.info) for possible `key` values.
