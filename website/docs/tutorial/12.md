# 12 - Sprite Props

To avoid our game auto-starting every time it loads, we need a way to pause the game, for example when in a menu screen. We can do this by passing `props` between Sprites.

In our `Level` Sprite we can setup a `paused` prop which we access in the `loop` method. Pausing is simple: we just return early with the current `state` to avoid any of the game logic running.

Then in our top-level `Game` Sprite we add some state to know if we're viewing the menu or not. If we are, we pause the level by passing the `paused` prop in.
