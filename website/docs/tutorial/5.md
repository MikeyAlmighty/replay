# 5 - Game Size

In our `gameProps` `size`, we set a height of 600 and width of 400, which works well for portrait devices. Note that these are game coordinates, not pixels! The important thing is the _aspect ratio_ (width and height ratio).

Our game has a 3:2 aspect ratio, but our iPhone on the right has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which caused black bars to be rendered at the top and bottom before.

To fix this we can add a height _margin_. Update `gameProps` with a `maxHeightMargin` to remove the black bars.

Our 400x600 area is the _safe zone_ where we put important things. Outside of this area may not be visible on some screens, depending on their size, but you can still fill it up with visuals like backgrounds.
