# 18 - Image

As beautiful as our yellow bird rectangle is, it would look even better to use an image in its place. I've taken some artwork from this [Open Game Art submission](https://opengameart.org/content/bevouliin-free-game-character-yellow-flappy-bird).

replay-starter stores its images in the `assets/images` folder, so we can copy one of the PNG files from Open Game Art to there as `bird.png`.

In our `Bird` Sprite we replace the rectangle with the `t.image` Texture, set to the same width and height.

Lastly, in `web/index`, we need to register the file name to load.
