# 3 - Game Sprite

On its own, our `Bird` Sprite doesn't do anything - we need to import it in another Sprite. Open `src/index` and replace the starter code with what's shown on the right.

Firstly you'll see we've made a new `Game` Sprite. This is our top-level Sprite which contains our entire game.

Again, it has a `render` function returning an array of Sprites. In this case, we return our `Bird` Sprite we just made. We need to pass a locally unique `id` `prop` to any custom Sprites we've made - here we pass an `id` of `"bird"` by _calling_ the `Bird` Sprite like `Bird(props)`.
