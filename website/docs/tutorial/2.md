# 2 - Bird Sprite

Let's start off by creating our bird in a new file within the `src` folder, as you can see in the code block on the right.

We'll represent our bird as a _Sprite_. Sprites are the building blocks of Replay, and provide a neat way to modularise our code.

For now we'll just render a yellow rectangle in the middle of the screen. To do this we create a new Sprite with `makeSprite`, passing in an object with a `render` method.

All Sprites need a `render` method which returns an array of other Sprites. For our bird, we return a rectangle _Texture_. Textures are elements to draw onto the screen like text, images and shapes. In this case, we use Replay's `t.rectangle` Texture, and pass in the width, height and color _`props`_.
