# 15 - Collision Detection

Next we need to add some collision detection to see if the bird hit a pipe or fell off the bottom of the screen.

We'll add a callback prop `gameOver` in the `Level` Sprite which can return us to the main menu. Then in the `loop` method we call it when the `didHitPipe` function returns `true`.

In Replay one way of performing collision detection is by checking if a point is within a rectangle, like the `pointInRect` function defined at the bottom of the `level` file does.

In `didHitPipe` we essentially choose a few points around the shape of the bird, and see if any of those are inside one of the pipe rectangles - if so, it's a hit! For simplicity, this function doesn't account for the bird's rotation; as an exercise, feel free to try to add that for a more accurate hit detection.

We update our top-level `Game` Sprite to change its view state to `"menu"` in the `gameOver` callback prop.

You'll also see an `attempt` count added in the state. Even though we don't display this, it's a neat hack to force the `Level` to reset its state whenever we start again by changing its `id` prop. Replay uses the `id` to track state between Sprites (which is why it has to be unique locally), but we can also use that to reset a Sprite's state.
