# 7 - Game Loop

We have state, but we still don't have movement since the state never changes.

We can update the state in the `loop` Sprite method. `loop`, which runs 60 times per second, takes an existing `state` and returns the next frame's `state`. `loop` should be a _pure_ function: avoid directly mutating `state`.

In our game, every frame of the `loop` we're updating the `birdY` state, as well as the gravity for a more "flappy" effect. This provides some movement!

You'll need to refresh the preview on the right to see it since our bird is currently falling forever.
